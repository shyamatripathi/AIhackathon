Project Title: AI for Citizen Safety: CyberGuard AI Hackathon Solution
Project Description:
The CyberGuard AI Hackathon under the IndiaAI Application Development Initiative (IADI) aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance cybersecurity across India. This project invites innovators, researchers, and entrepreneurs to develop AI-driven solutions that address the growing challenges of cyber fraud and cybercrime. The hackathon aligns with IndiaAIâ€™s mission to democratize AI and foster technological independence, collaborating with the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs. This partnership focuses on transforming the fight against cybercrime by equipping Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) with advanced AI tools and models that can optimize the detection, investigation, and prosecution of cyber offenses.

Objectives:
Enhance Cybercrime Detection and Prevention:

Develop AI algorithms that can proactively detect patterns indicative of cyber threats, helping to prevent potential cyber attacks before they escalate.
Use machine learning to classify different types of cybercrime, such as financial fraud, phishing, and social engineering attacks, to optimize resources and prioritize responses.
